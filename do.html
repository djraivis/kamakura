        <h1>Kamakura Hiking Trails</h1>
        <p>Kamakura is surrounded by the ocean in the south and by wooded hills in all other directions. Attractive hiking trails lead through the woods along these hills and connect various atmospheric temples. They are a great way to travel between some of Kamakura's sights. Many of the trails do not take long to complete - typically between 30 to 90 minutes - and allow visitors to enjoy a mix of nature and cultural sights.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Hiking</h2>
      <p>Kamakura has several hiking trails that can provide relief from the crowds at the more popular shrines and temples. The Daibutsu hiking course starts a few hundred meters down the road from Kōtokuin. The trail has several offshoots that lead to various small shrines and temples. If it has rained recently, the trail could be muddy and there are several steep sections.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Beaches</h2>
      <p>Kamakura is not just a historical city which has a lot of temples, shrines, and other historical buildings — there are also some popular beaches in Kamakura. You can feel the atmosphere of the Shonan Coast in the bright sunshine and have a good time there, especially in summer.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Western Hills</h2>
      <p>The Daibutsu Hiking Course connects Jochiji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with the Great Buddha (Daibutsu) in the west of the city. The Zeniarai Benten and the Genjiyama public park with a statue of Minamoto Yoritomo can be found underway. It takes about 60-90 minutes to complete the entire trail.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Northern Hills</h2>
      <p>The Tenen Hiking Course connects Kenchoji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with Zuisenji Temple in the east of the city, leading mostly along the ridge of the hills. The whole trail takes about 60-90 minutes to complete, and hikers can find several tomb caves (yagura) along their way. The trail can also be accessed through the Shishimai Valley, which is a popular spot for autumn colors in early December.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Eastern Hills</h2>
      <p>The Gionyama Hiking Course connects Yagumo Shrine with the Harakiri Yagura, a cave tomb where the last Hojo regent is said to have committed ritual suicide. Some nice views of the city can be enjoyed underway. The trail is shorter than the other two, taking about 30 minutes to complete.</p>

      <h2 class="sidebar-title">Yuigahama</h2>
      <p>Yuigahama (由比ヶ浜). This is a representative beach in Kamakura, so many people visit in summer to enjoy the sea-bathing there. It is also a spot for a good view of the firework display held in summer. Kamakura is famous for aquatic fireworks. (Just remember when walking along this beach that it was not so long ago that a lot of dismembered heads buried in and near the sand were found. The heads were very old, from an era when Japan was not such a friendly place).</p>

      <h2 class="sidebar-title">Inamuragasaki</h2>
      <p>Inamuragasaki (稲村ヶ崎). This is also a famous beach. The Inamuragasaki Park (稲村ガ崎公園 Inamuragasaki Kōen) is located there and is well known for its sunsets. The film "Inamura Jane" (稲村ジェーン), directed by Keisuke Kuwata, was set there. The remains of the Hojo, Kamakura's government, was destroyed there in 1333. It follows along National Road 134.</p>

      <h2 class="sidebar-title">Shichirigahama</h2>
      <p>Shichirigahama (七里ヶ浜). This is also a famous beach in Kamakura. Unfortunately, swimming is prohibited. But it's still a good beach to relax and have an enjoyable time. Many surfers enjoy surfing there.</p>
