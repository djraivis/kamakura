                <h1>KAMAKURA, JAPAN</h1>
                <p>Kamakura is a seaside Japanese city just south of Tokyo. The political center of medieval Japan,
                    modern-day Kamakura is a prominent resort town with dozens of Buddhist Zen temples and Shinto
                    shrines. Its most recognizable landmark is the Kotoku-in Temple’s Great Buddha, a roughly 13m-high
                    bronze statue still standing after a 15th-century tsunami. Yuigahama Beach on Sagami Bay is a
                    popular surfing spot.</p>

                <!-- <h1>Get in</h1> -->
                <p>Kamakura is 56km south of Tokyo and 27km south of Yokohama. It is usually visited as a day trip from
                    Tokyo, sometimes along with Yokohama.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Get Around</h2>
            <p>Kamakura is just a little too big to cover on foot, but a network of buses radiates out from the train
                station. Kotokuin and Hasedera can also be reached by taking the Enoden line three stops out to Hase
                station. Another option is to rent a bicycle. <br><br>
                For the energetic ones, there is a nice hike starting from Jōchiiji temple and ending near the Kōtokuin.
                You will walk, with some climbing, through forest. The hike also passes through Zeniarai Benten Shrine,
                if you are curious about the money washing ceremony. The hike takes about 3 hours, if you also stop and
                visit the temples along the way. Even in summer, the shade on the path manages to keep the temperature
                bearable. If you are on a day-trip, doing the hike limits a bit the chances of visiting some of the less
                reachable temples. An easy way to get to Jōchiiji temple is to take the JR Line train from Kamakura
                station to Kitakamakura Station where the temple can be found by exiting the station, turning left and
                walking 500m up the road. The walk starts to the left of the temple and you are not required to pay the
                ¥200 entrance fee to the temple to start the hike.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p>Evidence shows human settlement in Kamakura at least 10,000 years ago. Kamakura was the political capital
                of Japan during the Kamakura shogunate, from 1185 to 1333. On July 3, 1333, the reign of the Hōjō clan
                ended with the Siege of Kamakura. It is estimated that over 6,000 people committed suicide on that day.
                In 1956, 556 skeletons of people that died violently around that time were found.
                <br><br>
                After the Tokugawa clan moved the capital to present-day Tokyo, Kamakura continued its decline to become
                a mere fishing village. By 1910, the population had declined to 7,250 people.
                <br><br>
                Kamakura sustained significant damage during the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923.

            <p>Narita Airport is 123km northeast of Kamakura.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/nex_round.html">

                    N'EX Tokyo Round-Trip Ticket</a> is the cheapest way for foreigners to travel from Narita Airport to
                cities in the greater Tokyo region. The ticket costs ¥4,000. JR commuter trains depart Narita Airport in
                the direction of Yokohama or Ofuna once per hour. Some trains offer direct service to Kamakura station,
                otherwise change at wherever the train terminates to the next train bound for Zushi, Yokosuka or
                Kurihama (About 2 1/2 hours, ¥2,210). These trains offer a Green Car seating upgrade for ¥950. Green
                cars have more comfortable seats and a drink and snack service. <br><br>

                From Haneda Airport, take any Keikyu Line Airport Express (エアポート急行) train bound for Shin-Zushi or
                Kanazawa-Bunko, and change at Yokohama station for the JR Yokosuka line (One hour, ¥800).
                <br><br>
                Accommodation is usually cheaper in Tokyo and it may be worthwhile to spend a night in Tokyo before
                traveling to Kamakura.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sidebar-title">By train</h2>
            <p>The fastest way to Kamakura Station is by JR Yokosuka Line from Tokyo Station (one hour, ¥920) or
                Yokohama (25 minutes, ¥330). The JR Kamakura-Enoshima Pass gets you a round trip in this area with
                unlimited use of JR, Enoden and Shonan Monorail lines. You can buy the ticket at Ofuna, Fujisawa,
                Kamakura or Kita-Kamakura Station.
                <br><br>
                An alternative is to take the private Odakyu line from Shinjuku to Fujisawa, then change onto the
                rattling old Enoden (江ノ電) half-train/half-streetcar line that terminates in Kamakura (90 minutes total).
                The longer travel time is compensated for by views of Enoshima island and the Shonan coast. The <a
                    href="https://www.odakyu.jp/english/passes/enoshima_kamakura/">Enoshima-Kamakura Free Pass</a> will
                get you a roundtrip from Shinjuku (or other Odakyu, Seibu and Sotetsu stations) and unlimited use of the
                Enoden line for one day.
